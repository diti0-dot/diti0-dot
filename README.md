# Hello, I'm Diti 👋

I’m a Computer Science student interested in web development. I enjoy 3D modeling and like seeing how things come together as I build them. I’m a self-learner and have been exploring Ruby on Rails and React through The Odin Project. Learning by doing works best for me.

I also love plants and enjoy learning about other cultures. I’m fascinated by complex systems, from the human body to CPUs, airplanes, and the internet. Seeing how all the parts work together is very interesting.

I am always open to collaboration and learning new skills. Feel free to reach out at **[ditidotio@gmail.com](mailto:ditidotio@gmail.com)**
